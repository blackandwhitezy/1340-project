1340 project H&amp;Z stage 1
Build a system that will shorten the grocery store waiting line for cashiers and maximize the profit.
There is one line of customers with grocery waiting in line for the cashiers. The more the grocery one
customer has, the time it takes to spend at the register will be longer. If the waiting time is longer
than 15 minutes, the customers will leave without buying anything. Opening a new register costs an
activation fee. Known variables about the grocery include grocery types, price and amount.
Minimally, the system shall include basic features including 
1) read from grocery file
get input information: type of grocery and its profit;
2) randomly generate a customer (at least 50 customers for testing) with random grocery; 
3) calculate the processing time of one customer spent in the cashier, the time is proportional with the amount of grocery one customer has bought;
4) the system is able to sort customers into cashier; 5) (optional) express
line for grocery amount under 5; 6) profit should be positive at the end of testing. Imagine how a real
grocery store will work with a long line of customer and how to optimize the number of cashier
available due to the number of customers
